# RxJS 3.0.0-alpha

Reactive Extensions library for ES6.

## Building

There isn't really a "build" for this library. The modules are meant to be in ES6 format for consumption.

## Tests

For now, tests are run through the broccolijs development server.

install broccoli

```sh
npm install -g broccoli-cli
```

serve dev server

```sh
broccoli serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in any browser to view the tests.
